## Loading and preprocessing the data

fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
destFile <- "~/coursera/datascience/Course5-ReproducibleResearch/Week2/data.zip"
xtract <- "~/coursera/datascience/Course5-ReproducibleResearch/Week2"
fileName <- paste(xtract,"/activity.csv",sep="")

download.file(fileURL, destfile = destFile )
unzip(destFile, exdir = xtract)

if(file.exists(fileName)){ 
  actData <- read.csv(fileName,na.strings = "NA")
}

summary(actData)
str(actData)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

aggrS <- aggregate(actData$steps, by=list(as.Date(actData$date,"%Y-%m-%d")),sum)
colnames(aggrS) <- c("Date","NumSteps")
qplot(aggrS$Date, xlab = "Date", ylab="Number of steps by day", main ="Total number of Steps taken per day") + geom_histogram(aes(weight=aggrS$NumSteps))


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
aggrMn <- aggregate(actData$steps, by=list(as.Date(actData$date,"%Y-%m-%d")),mean)
colnames(aggrMn) <- c("Date","NumSteps")
qplot(aggrMn$Date, xlab = "Date", ylab="Number of steps by day", main ="Average number of Steps taken per day") + geom_histogram(aes(weight = aggrMn$NumSteps))



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
